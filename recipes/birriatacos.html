            <p>
                Birria is a meat stew or soup. The meat is marinated in an adobo made of 
                vinegar, dried chilies, garlic, and herbs and spices before being cooked
                in a broth.
                Taco is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a small hand-sized corn
                or wheat based tortilla topped with a filling. The tortilla is folded 
                the filling before being eaten.

                Birria Tacos are tacos filled with the stew's tender juicy meat and dipped
                in the birria. They are served with consomme, or broth from the stew.
